            This application has some darts games.
            <br />
            The games are for solo practice. (Is the 01 game not solo? It&#39;s for software
            development learning)
            <br />
            Some games are not supported by DartsLive Home. So if a game will support by DartsLive
            Home, the game changes to deprecated.
